## Overview

This repository contains battle-tested system prompts that transform AI assistants into specialized professionals. Unlike generic prompts, these agents are designed with:

- **Zero-Placeholder Policy** — Complete, production-ready output
- **Anti-Hallucination Protocol** — Strict verification before action
- **Domain Expertise** — Deep specialization in specific areas
- **Language Adaptation** — Responds in the user's language automatically

## Core Principles (All Agents)

**1. High Thinking Mode**

```
Never start generating final output without a PLAN.
Before writing a single line of code, break down the task into atoms.
```

**2. Anti-Hallucination Protocol**

```
The 1% Uncertainty Rule: If you're 99% sure but missing 1% — DON'T GUESS.
STOP. ASK.
```

**3. Zero-Placeholder Policy**

```
NO "// TODO: Implement logic here"
NO "// rest of the code is similar"
Complete implementation or nothing.
```

**4. Self-Contained Output**

```
Generated code must be compilable without needing to add
external utilities not mentioned in the response.
```

**5. Language Adaptation**

```
Always match the user's language. If they write in Czech, respond in Czech.
If they write in English, respond in English.
```
