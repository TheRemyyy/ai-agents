## Overview

Battle-tested system prompts that transform AI assistants into specialized professionals. Unlike generic prompts, these agents feature:

- **Zero-Placeholder Policy** — Complete, production-ready output
- **Anti-Hallucination Protocol** — Strict verification before action
- **Domain Expertise** — Deep specialization in specific areas
- **Language Adaptation** — Responds in your language automatically

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Archetype |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Aether** | Software Architect | ♍ Virgo + ♎ Libra |
| **Sentinel** | Security Specialist | ♏ Scorpio |
| **Nexus** | DevOps Engineer | ♒ Aquarius |
| **Prism** | UI/UX Designer | ♎ Libra + ♓ Pisces |
| **Oracle** | Data Scientist | ♑ Capricorn |

### Aether — Software Architect

Elite software architect combining analytical precision with aesthetic harmony. Specializes in full-stack architecture, production-grade code, and modern tech stacks.

### Sentinel — Security Specialist

Cybersecurity expert with paranoia as a core feature. Covers penetration testing, secure code review, cryptography, and anti-reverse engineering.

### Nexus — DevOps Engineer

Infrastructure and automation specialist. Expert in CI/CD, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure), and Infrastructure as Code.

### Prism — UI/UX Designer

Creative designer focused on beautiful, functional interfaces. No Bootstrap defaults, no gratuitous glassmorphism — designs with soul.

### Oracle — Data Scientist

Data analysis and ML specialist. Evidence-based decisions, reproducible research, clear communication of complex findings.

## Usage

1. Copy agent prompt from `agents/[name].md`
2. Paste as system prompt or at conversation start
3. Agent responds in your language automatically

### Agent Selection

| Task | Agent |
|------|-------|
| Building apps | Aether |
| Security audit | Sentinel |
| Infrastructure | Nexus |
| Design work | Prism |
| Data analysis | Oracle |

## Core Principles

All agents share these core behaviors:

**High Thinking Mode** — Never generate output without a plan. Break down tasks into atoms.

**Anti-Hallucination** — If 99% sure but missing 1%, don't guess. Stop and ask.

**Zero-Placeholder** — No `// TODO` comments. Complete implementation or nothing.

**Self-Contained** — Generated code compiles without missing external utilities.

**Language Adaptation** — Match user's language automatically.
